# The Vegetation Management Module Documentation

This repository contains documentation for the the FATES Vegetation Management Module.
The Vegetation Management Module (VM) is a research tool that allows the simulation of realistic vegetation management activities within the [Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES)](https://github.com/NGEET/fates).

There is not a lot to see here.  [Read the documentation here.](https://joshuarady.github.io/VegetationManagement/)

Management Beyond the VM Module:
There are aspects of management that aren't directly addressed in the VM Module code. For example, managed species may require new or revised PFTs.  ...

Beyond Management
While designed with management in mind we also recognize that the VM Module may be useful for a wider range of experiments. It provides a way to do initial experiments into ecological processes that are not yet represented in FATES.  

The *meaning* of a VM Event is up to you.  If you say a mortality event is a beetle outbreak, it is!  So if you have some information on the timing and demographics of an outbreak event you can easily set up a VM driver file to simulate it.  Most interesting ecological processes interact with and respond to climate so you are probably going to have to actually write some code to fully capture your process but VM may be a good way to perform some sensitivity studies before committing to the project.
